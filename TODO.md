# To do

- Figure out and talk about GitHub, PRs, etc
- Supply staging envs? How about local set up?
- TFTBOTR activity idea
    - Open with why are you here, what are you best at?
    - Mid-morning break: what's one thing you've improved so far?
    - End: hey buddy, SMART goal.
- Opening presentation, including activity prompt slides
- How and when to form teams?
- How much guidance do we offer on what to do?
- What work can we pre-load for them so that they can get on with FEDing?
- 5 runs on WPT too much? Will slow things down?
