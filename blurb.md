title: LGBT Hackathon blurb
---

This month on CTFEDs we're having a hackathon. We'll be working the sites of a handful of local LGBT organisations to help make them better. We'll be  focusing on Front-end performance: making the sites better, faster, and cheaper for their users. (We're still figuring out which sites we'll be working on)

We'll form teams based on the site that we want to work on and the mix of skills and experience we have. We'll benchmark the sites and decide what to work on.

The workshop will start at 9am sharp. Please arrive promptly because it will be a packed day. Thank you! :)

## About you

- You should be **familiar with HTML and CSS**. Some knowledge of JavaScript will probably come in handy too.
-  WordPress is a popular choice for the Content Management Systems of some of the sites we'll be looking at, so **familiarity with WordPress** (and with editing Themes and Plugins) will be useful.
- Bring **your laptop** and charger.

## About the facilitators

Dani, Justin, and Steve organise the CTFEDs monthly meetups and will be helping you help make some sites better. You can [read more about them on the CTFEDs site](http://ctfeds.org/organisers).
