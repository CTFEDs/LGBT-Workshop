8. Closing: next steps.

## Opening

- Why are we doing this?
- What do we want to achieve today?

## Form teams

Based on:

- site you want to work on;
- good mix of skills and experience in the team.

## Benchmark

Run the site through:

- [PageSpeed Insight](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/).
- [WebAIM's WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/).
- [WebPageTest](http://www.webpagetest.org/). Use the following settings (It should [look like this]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/webpagetest.jpg)).
    - Test Location: Moto G (Gen 1)
    - Browser: Moto G - Chrome
    - Advanced Settings:
        - Connection: Mobile 3G
        - Number of Tests to Run: 5
        - Repeat View: First View and Repeat View
        - Capture Video: true

**Note**: If you you're using the [WebPageTest API Wrapper for NodeJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpagetest) and have an API key you can run `webpagetest test <url> --key $WPT_API_KEY --location "Dulles_MotoG" --connectivity "3G" --runs "5" --video` or `webpagetest test <url>  -k $WPT_API_KEY -l "Dulles_MotoG" -y "3G" -r "5" -v`.

## Mini Kanban

1. Grab a bit of A4 and make a Kanban board with the following columns. It should like a bit like [this example board]({{ site.baseurl }}/print/ExampleKanbanBoard.pdf): big first column and small second and third columns.
    - Options ‚úã (Like To Do, but *not* a To Do list: we probably won't have time to do all the things)
    - Doing üëâ (Each person should only be working on one thing at a time.)
    - Done üëç (Huzzah! Nice one :) )
2. Review the site and your benchmark data and write a bunch stickies for things that you could do.
3. Go, go, go!
    - Pick one sticky to work on.
    - Put your initials in the corner and move it to Doing.
    - When you're done, move it Done and take a new sticky.
    - Repeat until awesome.
