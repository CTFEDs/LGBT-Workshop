## **Constraints! ðŸ™…**
## Don't change CMS
## Don't add complexity

^ Why? The most dangerous word in software: "just"
Don't add complexity for users: e.g. make it so they have to use Webpack, Grunt
As automatic as possible

## **Constraints! ðŸ™…**
## Don't change content
## Don't change design

---

## Add stickies to **Options âœ‹**
## **Small** things
## **One thing** at a time

^ 1 hour at most. Break it into pieces.
Want to **finish** things, not start things
Just CSS or just JS, not both at the same time

---


# Go, go, go! :raised_hands:

^ Pick one sticky to work on.
Initials in the corner, move to Doing.
Move to Done, take a new sticky.
Repeat until awesome.
